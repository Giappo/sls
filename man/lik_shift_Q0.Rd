  length(brtsS)), 1000)), cond = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{pars}{parameters of the likelihood functions:
\itemize{
  \item pars[1] is lambdaM, i.e. speciation rate of the main clade;
  \item pars[2] is muM, i.e. extinction rate of the main clade;
  \item pars[3] is lambdaS, i.e. speciation rate of the sub clade;
  \item pars[4] is muS, i.e. extinction rate of the sub clade;
}}

\item{brtsM}{branching times for the Main-clade}

\item{brtsS}{branching times for the Sub-clade}

\item{lx}{size of the matrix}

\item{cond}{type of conditioning:
\itemize{
  \item cond = 0 no conditiong;
  \item cond = 1 conditions on the survival of crown descendents;
  \item cond = 2 conditions on the survival of subclade and on the other crown descendents in the main clade;
  \item cond = 3 conditions on the survival of the subclade and both crown descendents in the main clade;
